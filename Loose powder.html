        <p><h1> Loose Powder</h1></p>
        <p><h5>Loose Powder: Also used to set liquid foundation/concealer so that makeup lasts longer and does not move around, or rub off of your skin. Typically used in the “baking” method of setting your foundation. Loose powder is also used to help define contour lines - or create a “chiseled” makeup look.</h5></p>
        <p><h5>Availability:59</h5></p>
        <p><h5>Description:A favourite for prolonging the wear of makeup, banishing shine, brightening and balancing skin tone. For a natural finish use a fluffy brush or use a sponge makeup applicator for baking precision to lock in contour and highlight. If you want areas to look brighter, make sure to damp the sponge and pat on a thick coat of powder. Loose powders are a good option for those who desire a luminous, silky and even finish.</h5></p>
